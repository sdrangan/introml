# How to Follow This Course

Below is the sequence of topics used in the class.  Of course, students not enrolled in 
the class are free to browse in any order they wish.  Right now,
we have very little material.  But, more will be added over the course of the class.

Ultimately, each topic will have a **demo** where the concepts are illustrated.
The demos are covered in the class lectures.  After the lectures, the students complete a similar
exercise on a new dataset in the **lab** at home.  Note the demos do not 
generally cover
all topics, since some concepts are left for the students to figure out 
for themselves in the labs.  Also, as you will observe, the labs are 
just empty skeletons with `TODO` markers that the students fill in.  Students will be 
provided the full solutions in class.  If you are an instructor
and wish copies of the solutions for yourself, please contact Sundeep Rangan at <srangan@nyu.edu>.
