# Setting up the environment on a local machine

Many of the demos and labs in the class use the powerful
[Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/).  Jupyter notebook is a web-based application which lets you create
and edit documents with live python code and rich comments and images.  It is ideal for 
teaching.  You can install Jupyter notebook and other software
on any personal computer (Windows, Mac or Unix):
* Install [jupyter notebook and Python](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
  Make sure you install Python 3 for the demos in these tutorials.
* Follow the [github instructions](./github.md) to install
[github](https://guides.github.com/) and download the course material.
* Later tutorials will require that you install [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

If you do not wish to run the code on your personal machine, all the software can
also be run in the cloud.  We provide detailed 
[instructions](./GCP/readme.md) on setting up a VM for this class in 
[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).
