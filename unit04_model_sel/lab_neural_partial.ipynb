In addition to improving our scientific understanding of neural phenomena, understanding neural encoding is critical for brain machine interfaces.  In this lab, you will use model selection for performing some simple analysis on real neural signals.  \n",

    "Neurons are the basic information processing units in the brain.  Neurons communicate with one another via *spikes* or *action potentials* which are brief events where voltage in the neuron rapidly rises then falls.  These spikes trigger the electro-chemical signals between one neuron and another.  In this experiment, the spikes were recorded from 196 neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1) of a monkey using an electrode array implanted onto the surface of a monkey's brain.  During the recording, the monkey performed several reaching tasks and the position and velocity of the hand was recorded as well.  \n",
