# Unit 6:  Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

The [support vector machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) 
is one of the most basic and widely-used classification tools.  
When combined with the kernel trick, SVMs can perform nonlinear classification
and have been successful in a wide range of tasks.
