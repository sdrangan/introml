    "In the [MNIST demo](mnist_svm.ipynb), we saw how SVMs can be used for the classic MNIST problem of digit recognition.  In this lab, we are going to extend the MNIST dataset by adding a number of non-digit letters and see if the classifier can distinguish the digits from the non-digits.  All non-digits will be lumped as a single 11-th class.  In image processing, this is called a 'detection' as opposed to 'classification' problem.  Detection is vital in OCR and related problems since the non useful characters must be rejected.  For this lab we will create a very simple version of this problem."
